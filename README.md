##DataSet And Data Collection.
This dataset was gotten from Kaggle. It consists of tweets from 4th January to 29th March 2023 of ChatGPT on Twitter. The columns Consist of Date, Id, content, username, like_count, retweet_count

#Importing the data
The dataset was imported into Power query on Microsoft Power Bi, I created a copy of the data in case I need to refer back to the original copy.  Here is an overview of what the dataset looks like

##Data Processing
I Check for missing values and removed the null values from each column. 
The datetime column was separated using a delimiter, while the time column was removed from the dataset since we will not be needing the time in the analysis. So, the date column was transformed into a usable form
A conditional Column was added from the content column to define topics that contain AI, ChatGPT, Elon Musk, Open Ai, Google, Where Sama, Microsoft, Youtube, Bill Gates, LinkedIn, Bing, and Mid Journey are grouped as others.

#Data Cleaning
This step involves removing inconsistencies in the dataset, such as duplicates, corrupted, and incorrectly formatted data within the dataset. Here I worked more on the Content column where I used the Find and Replace to replace wrongly spelt words. I replaced words such as chatGpT, chatgpt, ChaT gpt, chat Gpt, with ChatGPT. Also ai, Ai, and aI was replaced with AI, elonMusk, Elonmusk, Elon musk was replaced with Elon Musk, and google was replaced with Google. This was done using Ctrl H.
Also, Multiple spaced data was removed, and all irrelevant information, punctuations and stop word was removed from the Content column to ensure I work with a clean dataset. Duplicates were removed as well this is necessary because thereâ€™s a need to focus on unique insights and reduce the impact of noise or repeated content.
